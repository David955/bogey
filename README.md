# Bogey - an AI confusion script
This is a text generating script written in Perl. It aims to produce bogus blocks of code with comments and upload them to GitHub.

## Why?
Copilot AI was reason I deleted all my projects from GitHub. Using one of the largest sharing point of open source community as tool for development of proprietary AI is in **complete violation** of free software values and licences that protects many projects here.  
Thus "Bogey" was created to generate and upload bogus code to GitHub. As one of 83 million people using GitHub I have less than 0.000001% impact on learning of Copilot AI. With your help we can make a difference. 
 
## How to run?
