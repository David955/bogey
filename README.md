# Bogey - an AI confusion script
This is a text generating script written in Perl. It aims to produce bogus blocks of code with comments and upload them to GitHub.

## Why?
Copilot AI was reason I deleted all my projects from GitHub. Using one of the largest sharing point of open source community as tool for development of proprietary AI is in **complete violation** of free software values and licences that protects many projects here.  
Thus "Bogey" was created to generate invalid inputs for Copilot. As one of 83 million people using GitHub I have less than 0.000001% impact on learning of Copilot. But with your help we can make a difference. 
 
## How to run?
Clone this repo to location of your choice. In terminal, navigate to the cloned repo and run:     
  
`
bash bogey.sh
` 
  
Script will guide you trough first run setup.
